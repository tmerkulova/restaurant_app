#### Frontend Nanodegree - Restaurant Reviews Project

## Project Overview

### What is the application about?
This is the website for searching for the restaurants. You can find the restaurants on the map, also you can filter them by type of the cuisine or by place. Also, you can check the information (name, address, opening hours, and reviews) about each restaurant.

### Technical part
In **Restaurant Reviews** project, the static webpage was converted to a mobile-ready web application. The starter code was taken from [Udacity mws-restaurant-stage-1 code](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1). The accessibility features were added, the design was converted to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. A service worker was added to create a seamless offline experience for the users.

## How to use the application?

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`,
